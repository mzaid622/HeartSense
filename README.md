# 💓 HeartSense – Heart Disease Prediction App

**HeartSense** is an intelligent web application built with **Streamlit** that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** machine learning model.  
It offers users a quick and reliable way to assess their heart health based on key medical indicators.

## 🧠 Model Overview

The **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm is a simple yet powerful classification technique used to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease.  
It works by comparing new input data with existing labeled data and making predictions based on similarity (distance) to the nearest neighbors.
